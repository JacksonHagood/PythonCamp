This revised version of the Python Camp focuses more on straight Python knowledge. This camp is intended for older ninjas, as there is
just one text game at the end. The camp is designed for a 3 day setup. The c files are secondary to the lesson files if time is stressed.
Note: The provided finished files are there for the sensei to follow, but they should still write the code along with the students. If
there is not enough content, go through the extra projects.
